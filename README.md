# Soda cans detection in streaming video

Playground to test object detection and segmentation models on a video stream
to count number of soda cans.

Requirements: Python 3.10+ (mine is 3.13)

Models been used:

- [Ultralytics YOLO 11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/)
- [Ultralytics SAM 2](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/)
- [Meta's SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)

More to come.

Meta's SAM2 did not start, unfortunatelly.
